This project is to create a Windows Desktop game application for the classic Battleship game. The game will allow players to play against
an A.I.. The goal for the A.I. is to be able to make educated guesses where the player's ships are placed on the ocean grid. This will be
accomplished by the A.I. storing it's attack data from every match played to determine for the most common placed locations of ships.

The project will be coded using Microsoft's Visual C++/CLI framework in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.
